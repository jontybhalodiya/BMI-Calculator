# BMI-Calculator

The BMI Calculator project is a Python program with a GUI created using tkinter. It allows users to input their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms, and calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on these values. The BMI value is then displayed to provide an indication of the user's weight status.
